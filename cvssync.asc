== NAME ==
cvssync - fetch CVS archives via rsync

== SYNOPSIS ==
*cvssync* [-v] [-n] [-o outdir] host-path module

== DESCRIPTION ==
cvssync attempts to fetch a copy of a remote CVS repository into a local
directory.  All you have to tell it is the arguments you're expected
to hand CVS to perform a checkout of the remote.

If a previous cvssync has been done into the directory, cvssync will
do the least amount of file copying required to resynchronize the
local copy with the remote.  It relies on rsync(1) to accomplish this.

cvssync knows about the site-structure idiosyncracies of some major
CVS hosting sites and applies that knowledge so you don't have to.
Presently its rules are known good for SourceForge and Savannah.
Its default method should work for many other sites.

cvssync is an auxiliary tool issued with cvs-fast-export in order
to facilitate moving CVS repositories to version control systems
that aren't chipped out of flint. Of course, you can also use it
for backups and other purposes.

== EXAMPLES ==
Note that these examples may become obsolete as CVS repositories are
decommissioned.  They are meant to illustrate access patterns.

cvssync rfk.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/rfk robotfindskitten::
	Fetch the Robot Finds Kitten project from Sourceforge

cvssync anonymous@rfk.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/rfk robotfindskitten::
	Also works if you leave the login credential on; it's ignored.

cvssync -v anonymous@cvs.savannah.gnu.org:/sources/groff groff::
	Fetch the groff project repository from Savannah
