= The cvs-fast-export test suite =

You will need RCS and CVS installed to run these tests.

== The test loads ==

There are two groups of tests in this directory.

=== The .tst files ===

One group is generated by the *.tst files.  These are Python scripts
that use the framework in testlifter.py to create CVS repositories
(extension .repo) using the local installation of CVS. These can then
be stream-dumped and compared with the corrsponding *.chk files.

The standard check command rebuilds these repositories as they're needed
in order to dump them.  The clean production removes them.

This group is mainly a stability test.  The *.chk files are part of the
repository and are rebuilt only seldom, when there is genuine reason for 
the behavior of the program to change.

== The t9600 group ==

These are tests taken from the git tree for testing the cvsimport facility,
adapted for testing cvs-fast-export directly.  They are deliberately malformed
repositories that exercise strange corner cases.  

Each repo has a custom-built script using the testlifter framework to check
properties of the CVS repository against properties of the git conversion.
